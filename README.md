# BrainWave Scripting Repository
The Purpose Behind the Admin Script Repository

The BrainWave Admin Script Repository is a collection of Windows shell scripts, other scripts
(KiXtart, VBscript, Powershell, etc.), input and configuration text files, and executable files that
simplify the configuration and monitoring of Windows-based network environments of all sizes.

This collection of scripts has been assembled over many years, and refined for portability and
utility. The scripts you choose for the repository will almost always be a subset of the scripts
that you, as a systems administrator, maintain for your personal use.

Some of the scripts exist to manage the repository itself (and its distribution), enabling you to
publish to remote systems only those scripts which you want to have running there, while
keeping all other scripts confined to your primary workstation.

The distributed nature of these scripts, and the abstraction of the configuration files from the
script body, make it very easy to use a single collection of scripts across different divisions,
departments or even organizations (in the case of consultants or MSPs)
